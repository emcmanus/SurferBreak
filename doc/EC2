Documentation of the process I used for EC2.

Following the guide here:

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2006-06-26/


Generated and downloaded a new X509 Certificate and the private key file.

Noted account number: 3731-2819-1786 (without hyphens that's your EC2 User ID)

Wrote "set_environment" script in surferbreak/ec2/tools, which needs to be run before working with the tools.

Going to be using an Ubuntu image preloaded with the Rails stack. That's what I'm using on the rimuVPS and it's a common distro.

Using a small instance. Since this isn't a database I'm not worried about amount of memory. 32-bit Ubuntu 9.10, US-West:

Image: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2754

AMI ID: ami-c32e7f86

Added a keypair for the CALIFORNIA REGION ("ec2-add-keypair --region us-west-1 gsg-keypair")

Pasted the middle of the outputted value into id_rsa-gsg-keypair

Started the EC2 image ("ec2-run-instances ami-c32e7f86 --instance-type m1.small --region us-west-1 -k gsg-keypair" in tools/)

Instance id: i-4bc4c90e

Checked the instance status: ec2-describe-instances --region us-west-1 i-4bc4c90e

Authorized network access ("ec2-authorize --region us-west-1 default -p 22" only for ssh)

Connected with SSH ("ssh -i id_rsa-gsg-keypair ubuntu@ec2-184-72-3-59.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com")

Celebrated! TV break.

Copied the private key (pk-*) to the image ("scp -i id_rsa-gsg-keypair .keys/pk-SEX6FSNZULVNBU7OFWREU2WQ7TQITNSV.pem ubuntu@ec2-184-72-3-59.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:" the trailing ":" is required)

Saved the image as a custom AMI (In the running instance: "ec2-bundle-vol -d /mnt -k ~root/pk-SEX6FSNZULVNBU7OFWREU2WQ7TQITNSV.pem -u 373128191786 -s 2048" This gives the image 2GB of space)



On Karmic (Ubuntu 9.10):

Shell into "ubuntu," not "root." Use sudo to perform commands as root.
