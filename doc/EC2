SETUP

    Documentation of the process used to set up EC2

    Following the guide here:

    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2006-06-26/

    Generated and downloaded a new X509 Certificate and the private key file.

    Noted account number: 3731-2819-1786 (without hyphens that's your EC2 User ID)

    Wrote "set_environment" script in surferbreak/ec2/tools, which needs to be run before working with the tools.

    Going to be using an Ubuntu image preloaded with the Rails stack. That's what I'm using on the rimuVPS and it's a common distro.

    Using a small instance. Since this isn't a database I'm not worried about amount of memory. 32-bit Ubuntu 9.10, US-East:

    Image: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2754

    AMI ID: ami-1515f67c

    Added a keypair for the CALIFORNIA REGION ("ec2-add-keypair gsg-keypair")

    Pasted the middle of the outputted value into id_rsa-gsg-keypair

    Started the EC2 image ("ec2-run-instances ami-1515f67c -k gsg-keypair" in tools/)

    Instance id: i-b78121dc

    Checked the instance status: ec2-describe-instances i-b78121dc

    Authorized network access ("ec2-authorize default -p 22" only for ssh)

    Connected with SSH ("ssh -i id_rsa-gsg-keypair ubuntu@ec2-174-129-126-160.compute-1.amazonaws.com")

    Celebrated! TV break.

    Copied the private key (pk-*) to the image ("scp -i id_rsa-gsg-keypair .keys/pk-SEX6FSNZULVNBU7OFWREU2WQ7TQITNSV.pem ubuntu@ec2-184-72-3-59.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:" the trailing ":" is required)
