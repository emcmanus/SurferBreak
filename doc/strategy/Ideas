Strategy to Display Good-looking Games:

In general, only display games with user_has_selected_thumbnail set to true, meaning the thumbnail is probably decent quality.



Game Thumbnail Generation and Publishing:

Games can be in the following states: a) Unprocessed, no thumbnails, b) Unpublished, ready for metadata editing, c) Published

Don't reveal which thumbnail we've selected during the publishing step (push the user to select)
The "publishing" step will have to be deferred to when the games have finished processing
Create a status page (/account/game_status) just listing all games and their status
Make it easy to publish all games or quickly update the thumbnail
Remind the user of any unpublished games in a banner at the top of the page
Email user when all games have completed processing (and are ready to be published) if the user hasn't been active in X minutes
