Launch the site in a huge buzz campaign.

Soon after, open source all emulators under a non-commercial licence. Make a big 
deal over open-sourcing the core technology driving the site; an appreciation of 
the community and an effort to give back.

Launch with two or three other custom games alongside the emulators.
