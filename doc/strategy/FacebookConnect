Essentally build on Facebook's Users table.

When someone hits a game view page and is signed into Facebook, show which of their friends are on the service.

When a user signs in, show which of thier friends are a) on the service, and b) currently USING the service. Allow users to message their friends to set up a match.

"Would you like to make this match viewable to other players on Facebook?" Clicking yes will change the user's status to include a link to the match. Anyone can then watch the match as it happens in real time, and can comment on it.

After you finish the publishing step, "Would you like to tell your friends you just published this content?" Clicking "Yes" adds a status link to the that user's SurferBreak profile.

Opportunity to be everything Znyga will become, but 12 months ahead of them. (Strong off-site presence.)

There will be a certain friction coefficient, as getting users to leave facebook will be more difficult than getting them into games *on* facebook.


[Root System]

The events integration, posting match and publishing statuses, can be thought of as a "root system." We push user activity to Facebook in an attempt to get those users back to SurferBreak. In the same way that a literal root system draws water into the trunk of a tree, the SurferBreak root system draws users back to its site.

By taking users away from Facebook we can create significant leverage. SurferBreak's "roots" should not just be limited to just user activity, however. 

Published games on SurferBreak can become individual Facebook applications -- essentially shells around embedded instances of the game -- so users can bookmark single games and play them without leaving Facebook. Multiplayer matches and most SurferBreak functionality, however, will remain on SurferBreak.com.
