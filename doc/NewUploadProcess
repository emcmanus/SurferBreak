UPLOAD

    Files go directly to S3, and the Flash uploader hits a "file complete" controller

    The controller places a job in SQS (Using ActiveMessaging), marks the game as uploaded

    A server on EC2 polls for jobs, when it finds one it does the following

    Copies the ROM to a local cache

    Generates Thumbnails

        Two different options

        The EC2 instance inserts the appropriate rows into the DB (marking the game as finished, creating thumbnail objects)
    
        A client with DB access sits on the web server, looking for finished, but unhandled, SQS messages. This client then makes the DB inserts.
        
            -> Chosing this option. ActiveMessaging has a "poller" daemon built in that does just this.
